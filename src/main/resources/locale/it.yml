  # you can (and probably should) you override these in rankups.yml

  # however if you are just using money or don't need to change the message per rank, you can use any combination of:
  # {MONEY} {MONEY_NEEDED} {PERCENT_DONE <requirement>} {PERCENT_LEFT <requirement>} {AMOUNT <requirement>} {AMOUNT_NEEDED <requirement>}
  # {MONEY} and {MONEY_NEEDED} are different from {AMOUNT money} and {AMOUNT_NEEDED money} in that they use a different format.
  # here is an example of showing the requirements for just money:
  #list:
  #  complete: "&7{OLD_RANK} &8\xbb &7{RANK} &efor &7${MONEY}"
  #  current: "&c{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &c{RANK} &efor &a${MONEY} &e{PERCENT_DONE money}%"
  #  incomplete: "&r{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &r{RANK} &efor &a${MONEY}"
  list:
    complete: "&7{OLD_RANK} &8\xbb &7{RANK}"
    current: "&c{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &c{RANK}"
    incomplete: "&r{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &r{RANK}"
